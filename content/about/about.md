## About Me

Hi, this is Yunus Emre. I'm from Türkiye and living in Germany at the moment. I’m documenting my notes in this blog. Besides, I’m always searching for what’s new on the internet and working around so much programming stuff. My main focus is AI, game development and financial world like stocks or blockchain. You can always send me a message via e-mail or my social media platforms. Also, my previous works follow creating websites around SEO and I already exit them for discover new horizons.
